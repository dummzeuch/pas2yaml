# pas2yaml
copy of andremussche \ SemanticMergeDelphi which is a Pascal parser for PlasticSCM SemanticMerge tool 

Note that this fixes a problem with SemanticMerge 2.0 as described here:

https://github.com/andremussche/SemanticMergeDelphi/issues/4

But it has still got an issue:

https://forum.plasticscm.com/topic/20701-odd-calls-of-external-pas2yaml-parser/

Also note, that I currently do not plan to support this tool. This repository is just a convenient way to make my changes public.
